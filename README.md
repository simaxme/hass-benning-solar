# Benning Solar Inverter Home Assistant Integration

![](./logo/benningimage.svg)

This is accessing Benning Solar Inverters. This will use the internal Web-API of the Inverters to extract information from the inverter, such as details about current power usage etc.

## Setting up this plugin

Currently, this plugin is not integrated in HACS (though I will try to add it to the registry), so you will have to install it manually.

1. Please go to the HACS page of your Home Assistant Web Interface.
2. Click the three dots on the top right.
3. Click "custom repositories"
4. Add the URL of this repository: https://github.com/simaxme/hass-benning-solar-inverter.git
5. Select "Integration" as type
6. Click "Add"

Now you should see the Integration in HACS.
